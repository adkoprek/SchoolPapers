## About The Project

</p>

When I attended [Middle School in Turgi](https://www.schule-baden.ch/ueber-uns/sek-i-standort-turgi/) I was wraiting sumarization for most of the examinations for the subjscts: physics, biology, chemistry, history, geography and economy. 
After graduation I desited to clean up all of this files put them in one format and create a website so you don't have to write them. Now I'm currently going to [High School in Wettingen](https://kswe.ch/) and will probably continue with writing 
the sumarization for the examinations to come.
